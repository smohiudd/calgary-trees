## Exploratory Data Analysis of Urban Trees in Calgary

The City of Calgary estimates there are almost 7 million trees growing within city limits. The urban forest we see today is the result of over a century of careful planning, planting and maintenance. Using a dataset of public trees, I did a short exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of tree species.
